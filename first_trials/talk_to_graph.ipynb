      "1. Unusually high transaction amount: A transaction amount of 100,000 is significantly higher than typical transaction amounts for most individuals or businesses. Such a high amount could indicate potential fraud, especially if it is not in line with the customer's usual spending patterns.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Lack of prior history: If the transaction amount or timing is inconsistent with the customer's historical transaction data, it could be a red flag for potential fraud. A sudden spike in transaction amounts or activity without any previous pattern could indicate fraudulent behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Frequency of large transactions: Repeated occurrences of high-value transactions, especially during unusual hours, can be a sign of fraudulent activity. Fraudsters may conduct multiple transactions in quick succession to maximize their gains before detection.\n",

      "5. Lack of context: If there is no clear explanation for the high-value transaction or if it does not align with the customer's usual spending behavior, it raises suspicion for potential fraud. Understanding the context behind the transaction and verifying its legitimacy is crucial in identifying fraudulent activities.\n",
